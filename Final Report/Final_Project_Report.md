## Description
This project has two main objectives: one focused on software and the other on hardware.
We use PyTorch to investigate how post-training quantization affects model accuracy. Specifically, we apply post-training quantization at different precision levels—INT8 and INT16—to evaluate how these adjustments influence model performance.
On the hardware side, we employ open-source platforms like the NVDLA Simulator and Scale-Sim. With the NVDLA Simulator, we analyze execution time, and using Scale-Sim, we examine metrics such as utilization, mapping efficiency, cycles, and bandwidth.
By combining software and hardware analyses, we can assess both the accuracy and efficiency of deploying these models on hardware.

## Objectives**
The primary goals of this project are:
1. Software Analysis with PyTorch: Investigate the impact of post-training quantization on model accuracy at different precision levels (INT8, INT16) using PyTorch.
2. Hardware Analysis with NVDLA Simulator: Analyze execution time for quantized models deployed on the NVDLA simulator to understand their hardware performance.
3. Hardware Analysis with Scale-Sim: Evaluate metrics such as utilization, mapping efficiency, cycles, and bandwidth to understand how models perform in terms of hardware resource use.
