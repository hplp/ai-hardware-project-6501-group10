# **Project Final Report**

## 1. Project Overview**
- **Project Title:** [Performance Evaluation of CNN on Open-Source Platforms]
- **Repository URL:** [GitHub Repository Link]
- **Description:**  
  This project has two main objectives: one focused on software and the other on hardware.

We use PyTorch to investigate how post-training quantization affects model accuracy. Specifically, we apply post-training quantization at different precision levels—INT8 and INT16—to evaluate how these adjustments influence model performance.

On the hardware side, we employ open-source platforms like the NVDLA Simulator and Scale-Sim. With the NVDLA Simulator, we analyze execution time, and using Scale-Sim, we examine metrics such as utilization, mapping efficiency, cycles, and bandwidth.

By combining software and hardware analyses, we can assess both the accuracy and efficiency of deploying these models on hardware.
